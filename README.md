## Overview
CakapTalk is a AndroidApp Studio-based game created to obtain training data on Singapore's Singlish. Most assets and characters are handdrawn and manipulated using AdobeIllustrator Draw app on iPad and Adobe Photoshop. 

## What is it?
CakapTalk aims to collect data of different Singlish phrases. Players can record their own voices based on the pre-made phrases in the game that will be provided in two main categories: event and non-event. Event phrases came daily, weekly, and holiday-dependant. Non-event phrases are pre-loaded phrases that can be played whenever wherever.
The game was inspired by many modern popular apps namely: Tiktok, neko atsume, and many more. It follows the genre of Idle games where players are not expected to stay around their phone for a long period of time. The incentives of the game come from the feeling of satisfaction that players experienced when completing a set of collection and also just from the cute and interactive characters of the game that live their own lives inside the game.
